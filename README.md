Project Description: Solar Power Output Prediction Using Linear Regression
Introduction
Solar energy is one of the most abundant and clean renewable energy sources. Accurately predicting solar power output is critical for optimizing energy production, improving grid management, and supporting renewable energy initiatives. This project aims to build a machine learning model using linear regression to predict the solar power output based on various meteorological and environmental factors.

Objective
The primary objective of the project is to predict the solar power output (in kilowatts) using a dataset containing features such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation, angle of incidence, zenith angle, and azimuth angle.

Key Features
Temperature (2m above ground): The ambient air temperature influences the efficiency of solar panels.
Relative Humidity: Affects the clarity of the atmosphere and solar radiation reaching the panels.
Shortwave Radiation: Measures the incoming solar energy, critical for power generation.
Angle of Incidence: Describes the angle between the sunlight and the surface of the solar panel.
Zenith Angle: The angle between the sun and a line perpendicular to the surface of the earth.
Azimuth Angle: Indicates the direction of the sun relative to true north.
Workflow
Data Collection: A dataset containing the necessary meteorological and solar power output data is used.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, selecting relevant features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.
Model Training: A linear regression model is trained on the dataset to establish relationships between the input features and the solar power output.
Prediction: Using the trained model, predictions are made based on new input values provided by the user.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess its accuracy.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For implementing the linear regression model and evaluating its performance.
Matplotlib: For visualizing results.
Tools: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
User Interaction
Users provide input values for features like temperature, humidity, and radiation via the console.
The system uses the trained linear regression model to predict the solar power output and displays the results.
Outcome
The project provides a user-friendly interface to predict solar power output and aids in better planning and management of solar energy systems. By leveraging linear regression, it creates a simple yet effective predictive model.
